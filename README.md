# Why this project exists

**A plain-language, open spec for what “good” looks like at each stage of a startup—milestones, roles, and vocabulary you can share, fork, and build on.**
Written by founders for other founders & builders

Built by [Amandeep Singh](https://github.com/adsingh) · [Star on GitHub](https://github.com/Subtext-labs/startup-expectations-spec) · [Read on GitBook](https://subtext-2.gitbook.io/startup-expectations-specifications)

**Startup Expectations** is **for startup founders and operators** who want a clearer, shared picture of what “good” looks like as the company moves through stages — without wading through HR-speak or one-off blog posts.

Startups rarely fail because nobody cared. They often struggle because **expectations are implicit**—between co-founders, between founders and early hires, and between the company and the people it serves. That gap shows up early: what “good” means for the **company**, for **each role**, and **at each phase** is fuzzy, and everyone fills in the blanks differently.

We exist to offer **open, shared alignment**: a plain-language spec you can read, fork, and build on so everyone can point at the same picture of what matters **now** versus **later**, without pretending every company is identical.

Many founders wrestle with this in the first years—not from lack of ambition, but from lack of a **common vocabulary** for stage, runway, product readiness, revenue motion, team shape, and trust. This repo is one attempt to make that vocabulary **inspectable** and **versionable**, like code.

## Open foundation: Apache License 2.0

This content is **open source under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)** (see the [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) file in the repository). That means you can **use, modify, distribute, and build commercial products on top of it**—with the usual Apache-style attribution and patent-grant terms. We treat this as a **foundation layer**: copy it, adapt it, embed it in tools, and ship—without asking permission for normal open-source use within the license.

If you want a permissive base to standardize how startups talk about milestones and roles, **this license is intentional**.

## For builders

If you build tools—checklists, copilots, planning apps, hiring flows, board packs—**Startup Expectations Specifications** is meant to be **composed into products** that help startups work in a **product-first** way: grounded in what the company is trying to prove at each milestone, not generic advice. Treat the repo as something you can depend on and extend.

## Contribute

We want this to improve with real founder and operator experience. **Contributions are welcome**: tighten wording, add goals or stages that reflect how you build, fix gaps, or suggest structure in issues and pull requests. Whether you edit one page or propose a larger change, you help make the foundation more useful for the next team.

If you are unsure where to start, open an issue describing the scenario (stage, team size, industry) and what felt missing—we can point you at the right place in the spec.


## Start with your stage

The fastest path is to pick your current stage and work through the ordered guide.

| Stage | What it proves | Guide |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Pre-seed** | Problem and team are credible; first build and first learning | [Pre-seed guide →](spec/maturity/pre-seed.md) |
| **Seed** | Real traction or strong de-risking; seed round raised, early GTM | [Seed guide →](spec/maturity/seed.md) |
| **Series A** | Repeatable motion; raising to scale what already works | [Series A guide →](spec/maturity/series-a.md) |

Each guide tells you the job of the stage, what order to tackle things, what kills companies at that stage, and how to know when you're ready for the next one.

## How to consume this spec

This project is designed to be readable and usable in three distinct ways.

### For humans

Read it on [GitBook](https://subtext-2.gitbook.io/startup-expectations-specifications). Start with your stage guide, follow the phase table, and click through to individual milestone pages. Each milestone page explains what you are aiming for, what to focus on, and common ways it goes wrong — in plain language, without assumed knowledge.

### For AI agents and copilots

The spec includes a structured machine-readable layer designed for agent navigation:

1. **Start at [`spec/manifest.yaml`](spec/manifest.yaml)** — defines all entry points, schema locations, and an `agent_protocol` with explicit traversal steps
2. **Navigate by stage** via [`spec/maturity/index.yaml`](spec/maturity/index.yaml) — ordered `milestone_ids` per stage
3. **Navigate by category** via [`spec/goals/_registry.yaml`](spec/goals/_registry.yaml) — six categories with goal paths
4. **Load each milestone** via its `goal.yaml` — structured outcome data, signals, and load order
5. **Read context** via each milestone's `README.md` — human-language guidance written to be unambiguous for language models

The `agent_protocol` block in `manifest.yaml` spells out the exact traversal sequence. Agents should start there rather than crawling the directory tree.

### For software and professional tools

The spec is schema-backed and index-driven. Everything a tool needs to consume it programmatically:

| File | What it provides |
|------|-----------------|
| [`spec/manifest.yaml`](spec/manifest.yaml) | Top-level entry points, schema refs, agent protocol |
| [`spec/maturity/index.yaml`](spec/maturity/index.yaml) | Ordered milestone IDs per stage, stage proof statements |
| [`spec/milestone-index.yaml`](spec/milestone-index.yaml) | Flat index of all milestones with metadata |
| [`spec/goals/_registry.yaml`](spec/goals/_registry.yaml) | Category registry with goal paths |
| `spec/milestones/<category>/<id>/goal.yaml` | Per-milestone structured data: outcomes, signals, stage tags |
| `spec/schema/goal.schema.json` | JSON Schema for validating goal files |

The YAML files are stable and versioned (`version: "1.0.0"` in manifest). If you build tooling on top of this spec, pin to a release tag rather than main to avoid unexpected changes.

## What each goal page includes

Every goal has a short page covering:

- **What you are aiming for** — the outcome in plain language
- **What to focus on** — the 2–3 things that move the needle at this stage
- **What to deprioritize** — what does not belong in this milestone
- **Quality levels** — L0 through L3 so you know where you stand
- **How this connects** — cross-links to related milestones

## Contributing

Contributions help this spec stay grounded in how real teams build. To add or improve a milestone, see the [schema reference](spec/schema/goal.schema.json) and open a pull request.

If you find a gap — a stage, role, or scenario that's missing — open an issue describing it. Even a one-line description of what felt missing is useful.
